# Next-Gen Common Europe LoopBack Hackathon

Welcome to the LoopBack Hackathon for Power BeNeLux! In this Hackathon I will walk you through the steps for creating and securing a LoopBack REST API, based on a data model that we create for our fictional business, Benelux Books. Then, you are on your own to create some sort of application, website, or other solution that consumes our REST API endpoints to interact with our data.

This Hackathon is long, but I have _a lot_ of instruction, so let's get started!
