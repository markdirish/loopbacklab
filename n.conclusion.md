# Conclusions

Hopefully that went smoothly, and you now you can see the power of using LoopBack to create REST API endpoints. With very minimal amounts of actual coding, we were able to create data models, expose them as REST APIs, and secure them with authentication and authorization.

From here, there are so many directions you could go. You could create more models and to create more complex applications. You could try to use the `lb4 discover` functionality to create REST API endpoints from existing database tables. You could implement your own authorization schema that uses Db2 for i. There are so many parts of LoopBack that we haven't talked about in this workshop, that would take days to discuss. Use this workshop as a starting point, read [the LoopBack documentation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/index.html), and see what you can come up with!

If you have any questions about LoopBack or about any other open-source software that you want to integrate with IBM i, don't hestitate to send me an email (mirish@ibm.com).

And have a great conference!
